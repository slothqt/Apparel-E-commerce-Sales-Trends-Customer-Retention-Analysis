# Cohort Retention Analysis

This analysis tracks customer return rates by cohort from January 2022 to January 2025. Each row represents a cohort of users who made their first purchase in a given month, and each column (m1, m2, m3, m4) shows the percentage of that cohort who returned to make another purchase in subsequent months.

## Key Findings:

**>> Significant drop-off after first purchase**
  - Across all cohorts, retention sharply declines after the first month.
  - In their second month (`m2`), most cohorts retain only **less than 3%** of customers, with many even below 1%.
    
**>> Overall retention is very low and stagnant**
  - Later cohorts (2023–2025) show no major improvement in retention compared to earlier ones, suggesting that no major product or marketing changes have successfully boosted loyalty.
  - Retention in later months (`m3`, `m4`) remains consistently low, with most cohorts hovering between 1%–1.5%. This indicates that customers are likely one-time purchasers or have minimal engagement post-purchase.

**>> Possible issues**
  - Overall, the data suggests that most users do not return after their first purchase.
  - The consistently poor retention could stem from:
    - Customers not finding enough value to return.
    - Lack of remarketing, loyalty programs, or subscription options; leaving little incentive for repeat purchases.
    - Products possibly having seasonal or one-time appeal.
    - The business not optimizing the customer lifecycle or post-purchase experience.

### Key Findings:
- AOV exhibits sharp fluctuations (unlike steady user growth), which is likely driven by promotions, product launches, or seasonal campaigns.
- AOV has no correlation with user growth, suggesting that newer customers may have spent less or purchased lower-value items.
- The platform needs to focus on strategies to drive more revenue per customer, such as testing targeted promotions or campaigns, particularly during periods when AOV has previously peaked.

### Key Findings:
- Both male and female customers share the same youngest and oldest age ranges, from 12 to 70 years old.
- The youngest group has slightly more female customers (410) than males (358), while the oldest group has slightly more males (430) than females (368).
- Overall, 4 groups show a relatively balanced gender distribution, with approximately 392 individuals per group.
- These patterns could be useful for segment-level analysis if TheLook has niche products or marketing plans targeting these specific age groups.
